		### FTPS
		
		Azure provides secure FTP access access to the file system for your web app through **FTPS**. This allows you to securely access the application code on the web app as well as diagnostics logs. The FTPS link for your web app can be found with the following steps:
		
		1. Open the [Azure preview portal](http://portal.azure.com).
		2. Select **Browse All**.
		3. From the **Browse** blade, select **Web Apps**.
		4. From the **Web Apps** blade, Select the desired web app.
		5. From the web app's blade, select **All settings**.
		6. From the **Settings** blade, select **Properties**.
		7. The FTP and FTPS links are provided on the **Settings** blade. 
		
		For more information on FTPS, see [File Transfer Protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol).
