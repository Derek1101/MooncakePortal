		#### Example customization scripts
		
		Script Actions are scripts that are ran during cluster provisioning, and can be used to install additional components on the cluster. For Windows-based HDInsight clusters, these are PowerShell scripts. For Linux-based clusters, these are Bash scripts.
		
		The following are example scripts provided by the HDInsight team:
		
		* [Hue](hdinsight-hadoop-hue-linux.md)
		
			> [AZURE.NOTE] The Hue script is available only for Linux-based clusters.
		
		* [Giraph](hdinsight-hadoop-giraph-install-linux.md)
		
		* [R](hdinsight-hadoop-r-scripts-linux.md)
		
		* [Solr](hdinsight-hadoop-solr-install-linux.md)
		
		* [Spark](hdinsight-hadoop-spark-install-linux.md)
		
		For information on developing your own Script Actions, see [Script Action development with HDInsight](hdinsight-hadoop-script-actions-linux.md).

		###<a name="ambari"></a>Ambari
		
		Apache Ambari is for provisioning, managing and monitoring Apache Hadoop clusters. It includes an intuitive collection of operator tools and a robust set of APIs that hide the complexity of Hadoop, simplifying the operation of clusters. Linux-based HDInsight clusters provide both the Ambari web UI and the Ambari REST API, while Windows-based clusters provide a subset of the REST API.
		
		See [Manage HDInsight clusters using Ambari](hdinsight-hadoop-manage-ambari.md) (Linux only), [Monitor Hadoop clusters in HDInsight using the Ambari API](hdinsight-monitor-use-ambari-api.md), and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/apache/ambari/blob/trunk/ambari-server/docs/api/v1/index.md">Apache Ambari API reference</a>.
